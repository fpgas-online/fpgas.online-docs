# The camera on a Pi host

**You operate the fleet and want to know how a Pi's camera reaches the board's page, to fix or change a
feed.** From this repository's [`gst-libcam.sh`](https://github.com/fpgas-online/fpgas.online-cam/blob/main/gst-libcam.sh) and [`cam.service`](https://github.com/fpgas-online/fpgas.online-cam/blob/main/cam.service) (main
0c974d5) and the gateway roles `stream_server` and `webrtc` in
[fpgas.online-infra](https://github.com/fpgas-online/fpgas.online-infra) (main, read 2026-10-07).

## On the Pi

`fpgas-cam.service` runs `/usr/local/bin/fpgas-gst-libcam.sh`, which:

1. finds a camera: a CSI camera through libcamera first, else a USB (UVC) capture device, such as the HDMI
   grabbers on the NeTV2 hosts;
2. if it finds neither after a few tries, exits with status 78. The unit does not restart on 78
   (`RestartPreventExitStatus=78`): a CSI camera can only be connected with the board off. After plugging in a
   USB grabber: `sudo systemctl restart fpgas-cam`;
3. encodes H.264 at 6 frames per second (`FPS`, default 6), with the hardware encoder (`v4l2h264enc`) where
   there is one and `x264enc` where there is not (a Pi 5), with one keyframe per second, and a clock
   (`clockoverlay`) drawn over the picture;
4. publishes to `rtmp://<the Pi's default gateway>/pib/<the Pi's short name>`.

Any other failure (the stream server restarting, say) is retried every second.

## On the gateway

`stream_server` runs nginx-rtmp, which takes the Pi's stream and serves it as HLS under `/live`
(`https://<site>/live/<name>.m3u8`, which a desktop player such as VLC opens). Where `webrtc_additional_hosts`
is set (in `host_vars/fpgas.online.yml`, so on tweed), `webrtc` runs mediamtx, which serves the same streams
over WebRTC (WHEP).

The HLS under `/live` is served with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, because a cached live playlist is stale by
definition (`stream_server`, `live-hls.conf.j2`, infra main, read 2026-10-07). The board pages embed that
playlist, and each also offers the direct URL for a desktop player, `vlc https://<domain>/live/pi<N>.m3u8`
(from the earlier docs page, not re-checked).

On the gateway, `systemctl status nginx mediamtx` and `journalctl -u nginx` show whether a stream arrives; on
the Pi, `journalctl -u fpgas-cam` shows the pipeline's own messages.

## Latency

Latency is a deliberate trade. nginx-rtmp can only cut an HLS fragment at a keyframe, so the GOP length is
the floor on fragment length, and the player starts three fragments behind the newest. A 60-frame GOP at
6 fps meant 10-second fragments and about 40 seconds glass-to-glass (measured 2026-08-30); one keyframe per
second plus a 900 ms server fragment brings that to roughly 5 seconds (header comment of `gst-libcam.sh`,
main 4e75e21, read 2026-10-07). The WebRTC path above is separate.

## Which Pis have a camera

No list is kept per Pi. On a Pi, `systemctl status fpgas-cam` says: running, or stopped with status 78 where
there is no camera.
